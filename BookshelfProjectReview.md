---

##### _What went well_
* The project turned out well overall.
* We worked well together as a team.
* It was nice to have Evan in our team who carried out major chunk of the Javascript coding responsibility.
* Ronnie and Tiquilla both worked hard on different parts of the project.
* I took care of the __Read__ page css and am happy that it turned out nice and  the team liked it.
* I was running through some problems with __React__ and Ronnie was very nice to offer me help.


#####_Need Improvement_
* We could have had little more discussion and go over the tasks little more.
* The team collaboration was great but it would have been even better had we drawn out a pseudo code and tried to talk through how everyone in the team is visualizing the end result.
  

#####_Final Takeaway_
It was a nice learning experience to collaborate and work together with a group of people who possess different set of skills. 
It will help all of us in our future rolls tremendously.
